# Kaggle-Titanic-Survival-Prediction

This is a Machine Learning "Competition" on **Kaggle**. It's recommended you begin your journey on the website from here. [Here is the link to it](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) <br><br>

Here is the [link to my solution](https://www.kaggle.com/anujpr/titanic-survival-prediction) on Kaggle.<br>

Acompanying the code is some markup that should help you understand every bit of code and visualisations.<br>

Titanic is the famous ship that got wrecked back in 1912. We have the training set consisting of 891 entries and the test set consisiting of 418 entries of passengers data. We got to use this data to find out if the passengers survived or not.<br>

# How do we do that :grey_question:

The dataset consists of:

1.Passenger ID<br>2.Name of the Passenger<br>3.Age of the Passenger<br>4.Class of the Passenger<br>5.Port of Embarkment of the Passenger<br>6.Sex of the Passenger<br>7.Sum of number of Sibling(s) and Spouse(s) of the Passenger<br>8.Sum of number of Parent(s) and Children of the Passenger<br>9.Ticket Fare<br>10.Ticket ID or number<br>11.Survival<br><br>

Use these data entries for every passenger to create your own model to predict if the passengers in the test set survived or not.<br><br>I used quite a few models to check who has the highest accuracy.<br><br>Random Forest Classifier turned out to have a good accuracy amongst all models to predict whether the passenger survived or not in the end.<br><br>

Now, I'm pretty sure that my model isnt the one with the highest accuracy, so try other algorithms, use feature engineering and create other models that reduce the error in the predictions.<br><br>

Also try ensembling, while you are competing on Kaggle. Read about it [here](https://mlwave.com/kaggle-ensembling-guide/)
